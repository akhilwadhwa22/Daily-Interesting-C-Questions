C is a funny language!

While in lockdown for more than 3 months, I spent a large part of my time and energy in learning low level concepts of C language. What is a better to learn than to play around with the a piece of code? 

Then came the idea to why not post these questions on an open platform and help budding engineers like myself with these interesting concepts. To my surprise, it was a two way process. I really got to learning much deeper concepts interacting and discussing with some great minds who were willing to help us by sharing their knowledge.
