## C is a funny language!

While in lockdown for more than 3 months, I spent a large part of my time and energy in learning low level concepts of C language. 
## Is there a better way to learn than to play around with a piece of code? Print some statements, check memory allocation?

Then came the idea to why not post these questions on an open platform and help budding engineers like myself with these interesting concepts. To my surprise, it was a two way process. I really got to learn about deeper by concepts, which I was missing on, by interacting and discussing with some great minds who were willing to help by sharing their knowledge.
